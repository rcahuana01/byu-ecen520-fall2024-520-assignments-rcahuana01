# SPI ADXL362 Download

In this assignment, you will use your create a top-level design that communicate with the ADXL362 accelerometer on the Nexys4 board using the SPI protocol.

## Synthesis of SPI Controller Modules

Before proceeding with the top-level SPI design, it is important to make sure that your SPI controller and adxl362 controller from the previous assignment are properly synthesizable.
Create a makefile rule named `synth_adxl362_cntrl` that performs "out of context" synthesis of the adxl362 controller module from the preivous assignment (see the [instructions](../rx_sim/UART_Receiver_sim.md#receiver-synthesis) on how to do this).
Make sure all synthesis warnings and errors are resolved before proceeding with the top-level design.
If you made any changes to your modules to resolve synthesis errors, rerun the testbenches from the previous assignment to make sure they operate correctly.

## SPI Top-Level Design


module adxl362_top(
                ACL_MISO, ACL_SCLK, ACL_CSN, ACL_MOSI);

Create a top-level design that uses the following top-level ports:

| Port Name | Direction | Width | Function |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| CLK100MHZ | Input | 1 | Clock |
| CPU_RESETN | Input | 1 | Reset |
| SW | Input | 16 | Switches  |
| BTNL | Input | 1 |  |
| BTNR | Input | 1 |  |
| LED | Output | 16 | Board LEDs  |
| LED16_B | Output | 1 |  |
| ACL_MISO | Input | 1 | ADXL362 SPI MISO |
| ACL_SCLK | Input | 1 | ADXL362 SPI SCLK |
| ACL_CSN | Input | 1 | ADXL362 SPI CSN|
| ACL_MOSI | Input | 1 | ADXL362 SPI MOSI |
| AN | [7:0] | Output | Anode signals for the seven segment display |
| CA, CB, CC, CD, CE, CF, CG | [6:0] | Output | Seven segment display cathode signals |
| DP | Output | 1 | Seven segment display digit point signal |

| Parameter Name | Default Value | Purpose |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| CLK_FREQUENCY  | 100_000_000 | Specify the clock frequency |
| SEGMENT_DISPLAY_US  | 1_000 | The amount of time in microseconds to display each digit (1 ms) |
| DEBOUNCE_TIME_US | integer | 1_000 | Specifies the minimum debounce delay in micro seconds (1 us) |
| SCL_FREQUENCY | integer | 1_000_000 | ADXL SPI SCLK rate |


Create a top-level circuit that includes the following:
* Instances your ADXL362 SPI controller and attach it to the top-level SPI pins on the Nexys4 board. 
  * The accelerometer provides two interrupt pins (`ACL_INT[1]` and `ACL_INT[2]`) that you do not need to use for this assignment (do not hook up these pins).
  * Turn on LED16_B when your ADXL362 SPI controller unit is busy.
* The lower 8 switches should be used to specify the 8-bit address of the adxl362 register to read/write
* The upper 8 switches should be used to specify the 8-bit data used for adxl362 register writes
* The 16 LEDs should follow the value of the switches to allow the user can easily verify that the address/data is properly set.
* The left button (BTNL) should be used to initiate a write to the accelerometer (where the address and data to write are specfied by the switches)
* The right button (BTNR) should be used to initiate a read from the accelerometer
* Instance your seven segment display controller and hook it up so that the last byte received from a register read is displayed on the _lower two digits_ of the seven segment display. The previously received bytes should be shifted up to the other seven segment display so you can still see them (with 8 digits you should be able to display the last four register read values).

## SPI Top-Level Testbench

Create a top-level testbench of your top-level design that tests the operation of your top-level AXDL362L controller.
This testbench should be designed as follows:
* Make the top-level testbench parameterizable with the top-level parameters
* Create a free-running clock
* Instance your top-level design
* Instance the [ADXL362 simulation](./adxl362_model.sv) model
  * attach the SPI signals from the top-level design to the SPI signals of the simulation
* Perform the following sequence of events for your testbench:
  * Execute the simulation for a few clock cycles without setting any of the inputs
  * Set default values for the inputs (reset, buttons, and switchces)
  * Wait for a few clock cycle, assert the reset for a few clock cycles, deassert the reset (don't forget that the reset signal for the board is low asserted)
  * Perform the following operations within your testbench by setting the buttons and switches:
    * Read the DEVICEID register (0x0). Should get 0xad
    * Read the PARTID (0x02) to make sure you are getting consistent correct data (0xF2)
    * Read the status register (0x0b): should get 0x40 on power up (0xC0?)
    * Write the value 0x52 to register 0x1F for a soft reset

Make sure your top-level design successfully passes this testbench.
Add makefile rules named `sim_top`, using default parameters, and `sim_top_100`, that uses a 100_000 SCLK frequency, that will perform this simulation from the command line.


### Implementation and Download

At this point you are ready to implement your design, generate a bitfile and download your design to your board.
Create a new makefile rule named `gen_bit` that will generate a bitfile named `spi_adx362l.bit` for your top-level design with the default top-level parameters.
Create a new makefile rule named `gen_bit_100` that will generate a bitfile named `spi_adx362l_100.bit` with a 100_000 SCLK frequency.


Once you have created your design and downloaded it to the board, you can make sure it works by trying the following:

  * Read the DEVICEID register (0x0). Should get 0xad
  * Read the PARTID (0x02) to make sure you are getting consistent correct data (0xF2)
  * Read the status register (0x0b): should get 0x40 on power up (0xC0?)
  * Write the value 0x52 to register 0x1F for a soft reset
  * Write the value 0x00 to register 0x1F to clear the soft reset
  * Write the value 0x02 to register 0x2D to set "enable measure command"
  * Read the status register (0x0b): should get 0x41 now (you won't get any readings until the status is set to 0x41)
  * Write the value 0x14 to register 0x2C to set the Filter Control Register control register (50Hz)
  * Read the various accelerometer values to see changes in the acceleration (You can rotate the board around different axis to see changes in the readings)
    * Register 0x08 for XDATA
    * Register 0x09 for YDATA
    * Register 0x0A for ZDATA
