# Downloading Bitstreams

To test your synthesized and implemented designs you will need a way to download the bitstream to your FPGA board.
This page summarizes several different ways for downloading your bitstreams to your board.

## OpenOCD

There is an open source tool named [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org/) that can be used to download bitstreams to your board on Linux and Mac computers.
OpenOCD has been installed on the computers in the digital lab and embedded systems lab.

### OpenOCD Python Script

A python download script, [`openocd.py`](../resources/openocd.py), has been created to simplify the process of downloading your bitstream to your board.
This script is available in the resources folder of the course repository.
```
python3 ../resources/openocd.py tx_top.bit
```

### OpenOCD Manual Invocation

You can run the OpenOCD tool manually by following the instructions below.
To program your bitfile using OpenOCD you need to create a download script to instruct OpenOCD what type of device you are connecting to.
The following file is a sample OpenOCD script you can use to targe the Nexys4 DDR boards.
Note that at the end of the file you need to specify the bitfile you are targeting.
You will need a custom file for each bitstream you generate.

```# File: download.txt
adapter driver ftdi
ftdi_device_desc "Digilent USB Device"
ftdi_vid_pid 0x0403 0x6010
# channel 1 does not have any functionality
ftdi_channel 0
# just TCK TDI TDO TMS, no reset
ftdi_layout_init 0x0088 0x008b
reset_config none
adapter speed 10000

source [find cpld/xilinx-xc7.cfg]
source [find cpld/jtagspi.cfg]
init

puts [irscan xc7.tap 0x09]
puts [drscan xc7.tap 32 0]  

puts "Programming FPGA..."
# Note that the name of the bitfile must be specified in the line below
pld load 0 tx_top.bit
exit
```

To run this script with OpenOCD, execute the following command:

`openocd -f 7series.txt`

Instructions for downloading using OpenOCD can be found [here](https://github.com/byu-cpe/BYU-Computing-Tutorials/wiki/Program-7-Series-FPGA-from-a-Mac-or-Linux-Without-Xilinx).

## Vivado Hardware Manager

The Vivado tool suite contains a tool named the "Hardware Manager" for downloading your bitstream to your board.
If you have the Vivado tools installed on your computer you can use this tool to download your bitstream to your board.
If you don't have this tool installed on your computer you will need to physically access one of the digital lab computers and download while logged on to one of these machines.

You can run the Vivado hardware manager in one of two ways:
1. From the Vivado GUI by selecting the "Open Hardware Manager" option from the "Program and Debug" section of the left-hand tool menu or by selecting "Open Hardware Manager" from the "Flow" menu.
2. From the Vivado TCL command interpreter as described [here](./vivado_command_line.md#hardware-manager).

## Digilent Adept

If you are running windows, there is a light-weight tool named "Adept" that you can use to download your bitstream to your board.
You can access the Adept tool from the [Digilent website](https://digilent.com/shop/software/digilent-adept/) (Digilent manufactures the Nexys DDR board that you are using in this class).
Older instructions for accessing the tool can be found from the [ECEN 220](https://ecen220wiki.groups.et.byu.net/resources/tool_resources/ToolsUseOptions/#download-to-your-board-using-adept-2-windows-only
) lab web page.
