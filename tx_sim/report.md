## Summarize any major challenges you had completing this assignment
* Challenge 1. It took a lot of time to remember the proper syntax for SystemVerilog
* Challenge 2. Designing the circuit and understanding baud period and baud rate also was confusing to me.

## Provide suggestions for improving this assignment (optional)
  * Suggestion 1

## Assignment Specific Responses

Assignment specific Questions:
-Provide a short summary of how much HDL review you had to do to complete the assignment. Also, rate your HDL designs skills from 1-10.
I had to do a moderate amount of review of git and SystemVerilog syntax. My skills would be rated at 5.
-Indicate the simulation time of the two different simulations and suggest why the simulation times are different
Time1: 14881905 ns 
Time2: 4986705 ns
The second simulation is shorter time than the first simulation because the baud rate is higher for the first simulation.
