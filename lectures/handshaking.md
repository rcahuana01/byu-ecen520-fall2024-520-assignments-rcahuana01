## Handshaking and Data Transfer across clock domains

This lecture will discuss handshaking and techniques for sending data across different clock domains.

## Reading

  * 16.6-16.9 from [RTL Hardware Design Using VHDL](http://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/sfx.3578786?holding=i9vahb2m4z7qvbf3) (ignore the VHDL code)

## Key Concepts

  * Understand the need for handshaking
  * Four phase protocol approach
  * Two phase protocol approach
  * Single phase protocl approach (and its limitations)
  * FIFos and their purpose
