In this lecture we will review the different types available in SystemVerilog and how to use them in RTL design.

* 4 state types
  * wire, reg, logic
  * integer
  * Differences between nets and variables
* 2 state types
  * bit, byte, short int, int, longint

<!--
This should be split up into two lectures:
1. Basic types, logic and wire
- Reg, wire, var, etc. (creating registers with always and not always_ff/always_comb)
- Basic vericl
2. More advacned SV types
