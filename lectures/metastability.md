# Metastability and Synchonizer Design
When the timing constraints of a flip-flop are not met then the flip-flop may go metastable.
This lecture will summarize the causes of metastability and techniques for addressing metastability when it cannot be resolved easily.


## Reading

  * 16.4-16.5 from [RTL Hardware Design Using VHDL](http://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/sfx.3578786?holding=i9vahb2m4z7qvbf3)

## Key Concepts
  * What is metastability and why is it a problem
  * Understand how a flip-flop can go metastable
  * Understand how to use the stabilization time equation for a flip-flop in metastability
  * Understand the Rmeta, AF, and MTBF equations for metastability (and be able to apply these equations with a given situation)
  * Understand the purpose of a synchronizer and how it can address metastability
  * Understand the four different synchronizer types in Slide 40 of the chapter 16 slides 
  * Be able to analyze the MTBF of various synchronizer designs
